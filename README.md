# Repo containing the teaching documents for the Game Theory part of the OR3 module taught at Cardiff University.

This is still a work in progress but this repo might be of interest for two reasons:

- The game theory content itself;
- Some of the scripts I've used to create the teaching materials. I've used a combination of `tikz`, `makefiles`, `sage`, `sed` and `python` to routinely obtain the materials in a variety of formats (.pdf, .html and .docx). I wrote a blog post about it [here](http://goo.gl/usxfF).

You can see all the content at this [website](http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/) (hosted with gh-pages).
